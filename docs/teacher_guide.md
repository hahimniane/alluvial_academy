## 5. Clock-In & Clock-Out
1. Go to **Time Clock**.
2. The system automatically checks for an active or upcoming shift.
3. Press **Clock In** when ready.  A green banner confirms success and the session timer starts.
4. When you finish, click **Stop** – this records **Clock Out**, generates the timesheet entry and stops the timer automatically.
5. If you forget, an *Auto-Logout* triggers 15 minutes after shift end.

### Troubleshooting
- **Another active shift message** – An earlier session may still be open. Wait for auto-logout or contact an admin.
- **Location error** – Ensure browser location permissions are **Allowed**.
