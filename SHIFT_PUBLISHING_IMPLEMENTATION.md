# Shift Publishing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Teachers can now publish their shifts when they can't make it, allowing other teachers to view and claim them.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Data Model Updates (`lib/core/models/teaching_shift.dart`)
Added new fields to the `TeachingShift` model:
- `isPublished` (bool) - Whether the shift is published for other teachers
- `publishedBy` (String?) - User ID of the teacher who published it
- `publishedAt` (DateTime?) - When the shift was published
- `originalTeacherId` (String?) - Original teacher ID (preserved when claimed)
- `originalTeacherName` (String?) - Original teacher name (preserved when claimed)

All methods updated:
- ✅ Constructor with defaults
- ✅ `toFirestore()` - Serialization
- ✅ `fromFirestore()` - Deserialization
- ✅ `copyWith()` - Immutable updates

### 2. Publishing Functionality

#### **Teacher Shift Screen** (`lib/features/shift_management/screens/teacher_shift_screen.dart`)
- ✅ "Publish Shift" button on shift cards (for scheduled, non-expired, non-published shifts)
- ✅ "PUBLISHED" badge on shift cards that are already published
- ✅ "Available Shifts" button in AppBar to navigate to available shifts
- ✅ Publish confirmation dialog with warnings
- ✅ Unpublish confirmation dialog
- ✅ Firestore integration for publish/unpublish actions

**Publish Action:**
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('teaching_shifts').doc(shift.id).update({
  'is_published': true,
  'published_by': currentUser.uid,
  'published_at': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  'original_teacher_id': shift.teacherId,
  'original_teacher_name': shift.teacherName,
  'last_modified': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
```

**Unpublish Action:**
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('teaching_shifts').doc(shift.id).update({
  'is_published': false,
  'published_by': null,
  'published_at': null,
  'last_modified': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
```

### 3. Available Shifts Screen (`lib/features/shift_management/screens/available_shifts_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Shows only published shifts (`is_published == true`)
- ✅ Filters out current user's own published shifts
- ✅ Beautiful card layout with "AVAILABLE" badge
- ✅ Shows original teacher name
- ✅ "Claim Shift" functionality with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Firestore integration for claiming shifts

**Query:**
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('teaching_shifts')
  .where('is_published', isEqualTo: true)
  .where('status', isEqualTo: 'scheduled')
  .orderBy('shift_start')
  .limit(50)
  .get();
```

**Claim Action:**
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('teaching_shifts').doc(shift.id).update({
  'teacher_id': currentUser.uid,
  'teacher_name': userName,
  'is_published': false,
  'last_modified': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  // original_teacher_id and original_teacher_name remain unchanged
});
```

### 4. Shift Details Dialog (`lib/features/shift_management/widgets/shift_details_dialog.dart`)
- ✅ Publish button (for shift owners)
- ✅ Unpublish button (for published shifts)
- ✅ Claim button (for other teachers viewing published shifts)
- ✅ Smart button visibility based on ownership and publish status

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Published Badge**: Blue "PUBLISHED" badge with public icon on shift cards
- **Available Badge**: Blue "AVAILABLE" badge on shifts in the available shifts screen
- **Original Teacher**: Shows who originally published the shift

### User Flow

#### **Publishing a Shift**
1. Teacher views their shifts
2. Sees "Publish Shift" button on scheduled shifts
3. Clicks button → Confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirms → Shift is published and appears in "Available Shifts" for others
5. "PUBLISHED" badge appears on their shift card

#### **Claiming a Shift**
1. Teacher clicks "Available Shifts" button in AppBar
2. Sees list of published shifts from other teachers
3. Clicks on a shift or "View Details"
4. Clicks "Claim Shift" → Confirmation dialog appears
5. Confirms → Shift is transferred to them and removed from available list
6. Shift now appears in their "My Shifts" tab

#### **Unpublishing a Shift**
1. Teacher sees "PUBLISHED" badge on their shift
2. Opens shift details
3. Clicks "Unpublish" button → Confirmation appears
4. Confirms → Shift is removed from available shifts list

## 🔥 Firestore Structure

### Published Shift Document Example
```json
{
  "id": "shift_123",
  "teacher_id": "user_456",
  "teacher_name": "John Doe",
  "is_published": true,
  "published_by": "user_456",
  "published_at": "2025-10-03T10:30:00Z",
  "original_teacher_id": "user_456",
  "original_teacher_name": "John Doe",
  "status": "scheduled",
  "shift_start": "2025-10-05T14:00:00Z",
  "shift_end": "2025-10-05T16:00:00Z",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### After Claiming
```json
{
  "id": "shift_123",
  "teacher_id": "user_789",  // Changed to claiming teacher
  "teacher_name": "Jane Smith",  // Changed to claiming teacher
  "is_published": false,  // No longer published
  "published_by": null,
  "published_at": null,
  "original_teacher_id": "user_456",  // Preserved
  "original_teacher_name": "John Doe",  // Preserved
  "status": "scheduled",
  "shift_start": "2025-10-05T14:00:00Z",
  "shift_end": "2025-10-05T16:00:00Z",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 📋 Required Firestore Indexes

You may need to create a composite index for the query in Available Shifts screen. If you get an index error when testing, Firebase will provide a link to create it automatically.

**Index Required:**
- Collection: `teaching_shifts`
- Fields:
  - `is_published` (Ascending)
  - `status` (Ascending)
  - `shift_start` (Ascending)

## 🎯 Key Features

1. ✅ **One-click publish** from shift card
2. ✅ **Visual feedback** with badges and status indicators
3. ✅ **Confirmation dialogs** to prevent accidental actions
4. ✅ **Original teacher tracking** - shows who published the shift
5. ✅ **Automatic filtering** - users don't see their own published shifts in available list
6. ✅ **Expired shift filtering** - only active shifts can be published/claimed
7. ✅ **Status restriction** - only scheduled shifts can be published
8. ✅ **Real-time updates** - using Firestore real-time listeners
9. ✅ **Error handling** - user-friendly error messages with retry options
10. ✅ **Success feedback** - toast messages after actions

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**Firestore Rules to Add:**
```javascript
// In firestore.rules
match /teaching_shifts/{shiftId} {
  // Teachers can publish their own shifts
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && (request.resource.data.teacher_id == request.auth.uid 
        || resource.data.original_teacher_id == request.auth.uid)
    && request.resource.data.keys().hasAny(['is_published', 'published_by', 'published_at']);
  
  // Teachers can claim published shifts
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && resource.data.is_published == true
    && request.resource.data.teacher_id == request.auth.uid
    && request.resource.data.is_published == false;
  
  // Teachers can read published shifts
  allow read: if request.auth != null 
    && (resource.data.teacher_id == request.auth.uid 
        || resource.data.is_published == true);
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Publish a shift as Teacher A
- [ ] Verify it appears in "Available Shifts" for Teacher B
- [ ] Verify Teacher A sees "PUBLISHED" badge on their shift
- [ ] Claim the shift as Teacher B
- [ ] Verify shift disappears from "Available Shifts"
- [ ] Verify shift appears in Teacher B's "My Shifts"
- [ ] Verify Teacher B sees original teacher name somewhere (if implemented)
- [ ] Unpublish a shift and verify it disappears from "Available Shifts"
- [ ] Try to publish an expired shift (should not show button)
- [ ] Try to publish a non-scheduled shift (should not show button)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Notifications**: Notify teachers when new shifts are published
