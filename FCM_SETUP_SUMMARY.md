# FCM Token Management - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Token Saving on Login**
- When a user logs in, their FCM token is automatically saved to Firestore
- Platform is detected (Android, iOS, or Web)
- Multiple devices per user are supported

### 2. **Platform Detection**
Each token is saved with:
- `token`: The actual FCM token string
- `platform`: "android", "ios", or "web"
- `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of when the token was last updated

### 3. **Smart Token Management**
- **New device?** Token is added to the user's token array
- **Existing device?** Only the timestamp is updated
- **Token refreshes?** Automatically updated in Firestore
- **User logs out?** Token is removed from Firestore

### 4. **Firestore Structure**

```
users/
  {userId}/
    email: "user@example.com"
    name: "John Doe"
    fcmTokens: [
      {
        token: "dXcF1R2T3...",
        platform: "android",
        lastUpdated: Timestamp
      },
      {
        token: "eYdG2S3U4...",
        platform: "ios",
        lastUpdated: Timestamp
      }
    ]
    lastTokenUpdate: Timestamp
```

## üìç Where Changes Were Made

### 1. **NotificationService** (`lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`)
- Added `saveTokenToFirestore()` method
- Added `removeTokenFromFirestore()` method
- Added platform detection helper
- Tokens automatically saved when generated or refreshed

### 2. **AuthService** (`lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`)
- Token removed on logout
- Non-blocking (won't slow down logout)

### 3. **Main App** (`lib/main.dart`)
- FCM initialized on app launch
- Background message handler configured
- Token saved automatically if user is already logged in (1 second delay to not block startup)

## üéØ How It Works

### On App Launch:
1. Firebase initializes
2. NotificationService initializes
3. FCM token is generated
4. If user is already logged in ‚Üí token automatically saved to Firestore (with 1 second delay)
5. Platform is detected (Android/iOS) and saved with token

### On User Login:
1. User authenticates
2. User navigates to their dashboard
3. On next app launch, token will be saved automatically

### On User Logout:
1. FCM token removed from Firestore
2. Device won't receive notifications for this user anymore
3. Other logged-in devices continue to receive notifications

### Multiple Devices:
- User logs in on Android phone ‚Üí On next app launch, Android token saved
- Same user logs in on iPhone ‚Üí On next app launch, iOS token added (Android token remains)
- User logs out of Android ‚Üí Android token removed immediately (iOS token remains)
- User launches app again while logged in ‚Üí Token refreshed/updated

## üì§ Sending Notifications

See `lib/core/services/send_notifications_example.md` for detailed examples.

### Quick Example (Cloud Function):

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

async function sendToUser(userId, title, message) {
  // Get user's tokens
  const userDoc = await admin.firestore()
    .collection('users')
    .doc(userId)
    .get();
  
  const fcmTokens = userDoc.data().fcmTokens || [];
  const tokens = fcmTokens.map(t => t.token);
  
  // Send to all devices
  await admin.messaging().sendEachForMulticast({
    notification: { title, body: message },
    tokens: tokens
  });
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Build and run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Login with a test account

### 3. Close and reopen the app (or wait 1 second after launch)

### 4. Check Firestore:
- Go to Firebase Console
- Open Firestore Database
- Navigate to `users/{userId}`
- You should see an `fcmTokens` array with your device's token

### 5. Send a test notification:
- Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
- "Send test message"
- Copy a token from Firestore
- Paste and send

### 6. Test multiple devices:
- Login on Android ‚Üí Launch app ‚Üí Check token saved
- Login same user on iOS ‚Üí Launch app ‚Üí Check both tokens present
- Logout from Android ‚Üí Check Android token removed immediately

## üîß Customization Options

### Change collection name:
In `notification_service.dart`, replace `'users'` with your collection name:
```dart
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('your_collection').doc(uid)
```

### Add more metadata:
Modify the `tokenData` object to include:
- Device model
- App version
- Device name
- Last active timestamp

Example:
```dart
final tokenData = {
  'token': token,
  'platform': platform,
  'deviceModel': 'iPhone 14 Pro',
  'appVersion': '1.0.0',
  'lastUpdated': now,
};
```

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Multi-device support**: Users receive notifications on all logged-in devices
2. **Platform awareness**: Send iOS-only or Android-only notifications
3. **Automatic cleanup**: Tokens removed on logout
4. **Token refresh handling**: Tokens automatically updated when they change
5. **Non-blocking**: Doesn't slow down login/logout
6. **Error resilient**: Failures don't crash the app

## üì± User Experience

From the user's perspective:
- They login ‚Üí On next app launch, start receiving notifications
- They logout ‚Üí Stop receiving notifications immediately
- They use multiple phones ‚Üí Receive on all logged-in devices
- They switch phones ‚Üí Old phone stops when logged out, new phone starts on next launch
- They keep the app open ‚Üí Token automatically refreshes if needed
- Zero configuration needed!

## üîê Security Notes

### Firestore Rules:
Make sure users can only write their own tokens:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Ready to Use!

The system is now fully functional. Every time a user logs in, their device token is automatically saved with platform information. You can now send targeted notifications to specific users on specific platforms!
