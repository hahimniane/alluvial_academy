# Cursor AI Rules for Alluvial Academy Flutter Web Project

## Project Overview
This is a Flutter web application for Islamic education management, deployed on Hostinger hosting.

## Build Process Automation

### Cache Busting Version Management
CRITICAL: Before running `flutter build web --release`, you MUST automatically increment the cache busting version number to prevent users from needing to clear their browser cache.

**Automated Build Process:**
1. When you run `flutter build web --release`, ALWAYS run `./increment_version.sh` first
2. The complete command sequence should be:
   ```bash
   ./increment_version.sh && flutter build web --release
   ```

**What the version increment does:**
- Updates version numbers in `web/index.html` for `flutter_bootstrap.js?v=X` 
- Updates version numbers in `web/index.html` for `manifest.json?v=X`
- Ensures users get the latest version without manual cache clearing

### Build Commands
**For development builds:**
```bash
flutter build web
```

**For production releases (ALWAYS use this pattern):**
```bash
./increment_version.sh && flutter build web --release
```

**Never run `flutter build web --release` without incrementing the version first!**

## Deployment Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Run: `./increment_version.sh && flutter build web --release`
3. Upload `build/web/` contents to Hostinger
4. Include the `.htaccess` file for proper caching

## File Structure Notes
- `web/index.html` - Contains versioned script references
- `increment_version.sh` - Automated version incrementer
- `version_manager.md` - Documentation for cache busting system
- `web/.htaccess` - Server-side cache control for Hostinger

## Development Guidelines
- Always test locally before building for release
- Monitor version numbers in `version_manager.md`
- Ensure `.htaccess` file is uploaded to Hostinger root directory

## Cache Busting Strategy
This project uses URL versioning to prevent cache issues:
- Critical files have `?v=X` parameters that increment with each release
- Static assets use long-term caching with immutable headers
- HTML files are never cached

## Important Reminders
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER run `flutter build web --release` without incrementing version
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: `./increment_version.sh && flutter build web --release`
- üì§ Upload entire `build/web/` folder to Hostinger after each build
